### The Good:
- *Very* preliminary library with a ton of potential
- Powerful in the right hands
###  The Bad:
- Confusing and hard to get started on.
- Not being a front end Java Script developer will make customization very difficult.
- Formatting data and correcting data type issues can be time consuming.
### The Ugly:
- Package is in an undocumented state with few examples to work from.
- [!Existing samples don't currently work.](http://bl.ocks.org/ramnathv/raw/8970935/mymap.html)
