I recently submitted a DNA sample to National Geographic's Genographic Project. https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/about/
The project mission is certainly a worthy one, but the results provided back to participants could use a little more detail and polish.

One of the charts The Genographic Project provides is your hominin ancestry - that is, the percentages of your DNA purported to be of Neanderthal and Denisovan origin respectively.

Here's how they depicted my non-Homo-Sapien-ness:

Where to begin on this?..

I find the varying blue/gray hues to be distractingly similar to each other, and to make matters worse, the hue of the stated percentage does not match its corresponding ring. 
On that note, the use of a circle and arcs seem totally unwarranted here. It implies that the depicted percentages should add up to a whole amount, but I have no idea what that whole amount could represent.
The surrounding arcs representing the percentages appear to be sized in relative proportion to each other, and they visually seem to make up about 75% of the circle. This would imply that the full circle represents a combined 7.6% non-Homo-Sapien ancestry.
I suppose this could be an upper-limit estimate of the highest amount of combined Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA a human would be expected to have, but even if that's the case this doesn't seem like a very meaningful figure, as it would only be based off of the relatively small percentage of humanity that has taken this sort of DNA test.

The 3rd and outermost arc along with the text at the bottom would seem to depict 2.1% as the average amount of both Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA for all humans born outside of Africa.

The only problem is that those details are contradicted in the following "Explore Your Results" page:

The text is interesting enough, but it states clearly that "Most non-Africans are about 2 percent Neanderthal and slightly less than 2 percent Denisovan". 
So why was the 2.1% arc double labelled as the average in the prior chart? Is this supposed to be an "average of averages" or was it a flat-out error?

And once again, we see data being presented with circles that do not appear to convey any meaningful information. Why is the 1.9% circle larger than the 3.6% circle?
